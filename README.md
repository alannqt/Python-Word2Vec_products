Quick word2vec project used for shopee hackalthon (Rough code, done within an hour, but good enough for simple word2vec examples). The objective is to find "neighbour" words when key in electronics items. Please google for the Amazon dataset call meta_Electronics.json.gz as it is too huge to be uploaded.

I do not own the dataset
